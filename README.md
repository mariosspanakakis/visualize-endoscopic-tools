# Medical AR - Visualizing Endoscopic Tools

Team project developed during "Medical Augmented Reality" class at Technical University of Munich.

## Functionalities
Implements AR-based assistance during laparoscopic surgery. Generates a virtual window into the patient's body through which a surgeon can see anatomical structures (e.g. from a CT) as well as the location and orientation of surgical tools. Additionally streams the laparoscopic camera's view to a virtual screen that is automatically repositioned in dependence of the surgeon's position.
